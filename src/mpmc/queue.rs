//! # Multi Producer Multi Consumer Queue
//!
//! This is an unbounded implementation of a MPMC queue. This is not using an array with a fixed size as a ringbuffer
//! that is typically used for bounded MPMC queues and thus limitting the number of elements the queue can handle.
//! This implementation uses a single linked list to store its elements.
//! Elements are always pushed to the back of the queue and poped from the front thus providing a FIFO buffer
//!
//! The implementation tries to be lockfree and only working with atomic operations instead of Mutex or other
//! data locks.
